# Server Review (Recall)

In this article, you will review:

* What a server is
* What the role of a server is in a full-stack application

## What is a Server?

A **server** is a hardware or software that pushes and pulls data across
a network. A server's purpose is to send data to a client. A client can request
data from a server, and the server processes that request and responds with the
desired data.

## Role of a Server in a Full-Stack Application

A full-stack application is a Web application that has a front-end client and
a back-end server. The front-end client requests web pages or data from the
back-end server. The back-end server sends the web pages or data to the
front-end client when requested.

The front-end client in a full-stack application is responsible for displaying
web pages to a user.

Back-end servers provide many functionalities in a full-stack application. Some
functionalities include:

* Send the requested web pages
* Handle email messages
* Send files
* Store and send data in a database
* Process data
* Handle web traffic

Sometimes, there are multiple servers in a full-stack application to spread out
the different roles and responsibilities. For example, there could be a server
for sending web pages to the front-end client. That server could request data
from a server storing data in a database.

## What you've learned

You learned that

* a server is a hardware or process that sends data through a network a server
* can have many responsibilities in a full-stack application, such as sending
    web pages and storing and processing data
* a full-stack application can have more than one server
