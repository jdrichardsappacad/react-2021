  <question multiple>
    <p>What do we need in order to create a class component with state in React?</p>
    <answer correct>We need to import Component from the react package and
    create a subclass extending this class</answer>
    <answer correct>We need to call the render method</answer>
    <answer correct>We need to use the constructor and super methods if we want to have state in this component</answer>
    <answer>We need to bring in props</answer>
    <explanation>In order to create a class component with state, you need to
    import Component from react and create a subclass extending the Component Class. You also must call the render method with a return that is using
    JSX. If you want to create state you must use the constructor and super
    methods in order to gain the functionality of the Component class. Props
    are already inherited, that is built in.</explanation>
