# (Recall) Finding Information Based on Parameters

In this short practice, you will apply the knowledge you have in order to
complete the `SingleArticle` component.

You have two options for passing the `state` into the `SingleArticle` component.
Either pass the articles from the `ArticleList` component to the `SingleArticle`
component, or use the `useSelector` to load the articles from the Reducer. 

Using the parameter given in the `url`, choose the correct article from the
`articles` array, and display the information for that article inside the `JSX`


Congratulations! You have re-used the knowledge that you have for displaying
information based on a parameter.
