# Class Components Practice

In this practice, you will:

- Convert a Component from `functional` to `class`
- use the `componentDidMount` lifecycle method to set a timer
- use the `componentWilUnMount` lifecycle method to unmount a component

## Setup

Download the file for this practice at the bottom of this page.

Open the starter in VSCode and run `npm install` in the terminal.

Run `npm start` to make sure your project has not run into any errors.

Take a look at and familiarize yourself with the code inside the `/FunctionalComponents/FunctionKuiper.js` file.

Your goal will be to convert this code from a functional component to a class component.
