# useEffect Debug

In this exercise you will use the [randomuser.me api][randomuser-api].

The app should start out with a welcome page and a Login button.

When you click the button you should see a random user on the left with
information and a logout button beneath the image. On the right there should be
a search box where, if you input a different name for the user, you see a new
user on the left. The names will not coordinate with each other. However, if you
put in the same name again the picture will not change and if you repeat a name
it will show the person that was originally coordinated with the name.

When you log out, you should be directed back to the
welcome page.

If you refresh the page or if you logout and login you should see the last user
that was showing.

There are 7 errors to correct. Errors are not just
when the app runs but also warnings in the console.

Good Luck!
