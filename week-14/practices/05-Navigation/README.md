# Practice: Navigation

In this practice you will learn how to create navigation for your Route
paths using `Link` and `NavLink`.

## Phase 0: Setup

Download the [starter][starter]. `cd` into the folder and run the `npm install`
command in your terminal.

Next run `npm start` and check your browser to see if your code is running
properly.

Check your browser. You should only see an `h1` saying App Components.

Now take a look at the code. In your `App.js` you will see the already
created routes for each component.

## Phase 1: Link Navigation

Import the Link component from `react-router-dom`. You will use this
component instead of the `<a>` element to which you are accustomed.
